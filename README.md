# Dependencies:

* ruby 2.5.1p57
* bundler 1.16.1
* postgresql 10.4
* redis-server 4.0.10

# Dev dependencies

* ganache-cli 6.1.8

# Deployment:

* follow https://gorails.com/deploy/ubuntu/18.04
  * when you run `createdb`, the database name must match with the one specified in database.yml
  * you will need to temporarily make your database user a superuser to avoid PG::InsufficientPrivilege on the first deployment:
    1. Connect to the server: `$ ssh user@server`
    2. Connect to PostgreSQL as the superuser (not your database user):
      ```
      $ sudo su postgres
      $ \psql
      ```
    3. Make your database user a superuser: `$ alter role your_user superuser;`
    4. Run `cap production deploy` from your local machine
    5. Remove superuser from your database user: `$ alter role your_user nosuperuser;`
    6. Leave PostgreSQL shell: `$ \q`
* required environment variables:
  * POSTGRES_PASSWORD
  * SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY
  * CONTRACT_ADDRESS
  * FEE_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS
  * ETHEREUM_HOST (if deploying to main net)
* start redis at boot `sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service`
* double-check, make sure CONTRACT_ADDRESS is not checksummed and deployed, SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY is funded, FEE_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS is not checksummed and is the right address, ETHEREUM_HOST is pointing to the right network
* add domain
* add ssl certificate https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntubionic-nginx
* add tokens & markets
